        <h2>Loyal Rescue Website Overhaul</h2>
        <p class="push">Loyal Rescue is a foster-based rescue located in Peterborough, Ontario. This project involved giving their website a face lift in order to help their clients interact with their services.</p>
        <p class="push-double">The process involved sketching, mockups, and coding the majority of the pages. The end result is an accessible website without all the visual noise that regularly accompanies animal adoption pages.</p>
