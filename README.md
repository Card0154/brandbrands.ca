Brandon Cardenas, Graphic Designer

For as long as I can remember, I have always strived to do more than just answer someone else's question. I want to be the first to ask the impossible questions, so I can be the first to answer the impossible questions. I strive to have the answer. My mom always said it was because I was a Libra, but I think my passion for exploration, critical thinking, and problem solving is a product of my environment. When everyone is determined to see something fail, I'm determined to see it succeed. This is why I'm here.
